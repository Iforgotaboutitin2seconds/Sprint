Have you readed it yet?
Good!

Now contact the team to see if anyone is willing to lead you.
Remember the teammate that refused, and send their name to the team leader

Team Lead will make sure they actually had a good reason not to lead you.
Please let team lead know if you feel being treated unequally

For the old team member,
Why are you here?
Get to work!
